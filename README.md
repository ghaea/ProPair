## ProPair - The Iron Yard Final Project - FEE & RoR

This is the front end portion of the project.  The Ruby on Rails portion is being completed by Patrick from the RoR class.

ProPair is a hub for developers of any experience level to post projects and pair program with anyone, anytime, anywhere.  We've integrated Slack's API so that the users can message each other without ever leaving our site.  They can even use /hero to start a screenhero session to remotely share screens. 

Check out the screen-shots folder for visuals.
